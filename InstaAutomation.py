# USING SELENIUM
# Instagram Automation which can perform following tasks:
# 1. Logging in Instagram
# 2. Handling the pop-ups
# 3. Searching for a hashtag
# 4. Scrolling the feed of the hashtag
# 5. Downloading the resulted images to our desktop

#  WebDriverWait() is literally asking your webdriver to wait before
#  it executes the command specified inside .until().
# WebDriverWait accepts 2 arguments:
# driver: represents the webdriver object we initialized earlier (driver)
# timeout: represents the number of seconds that would pass before a Timeout Exception is triggered (10).
# An integer data type is expected (int).

# EC.element_to_be_clickable() has 2 parts:
# EC is specifying a condition for the wait.
# Simply speaking, it asks our software "don't run the command until my condition is met!"
# element_to_be_clickable() is one of the available methods you can choose as condition.
# It not only waits until the element is loaded on the page,
# but also waits until the browser allows clicking on that element.
# These methods take-in the element you'd like to select as an argument.

# By.CSS_SELECTOR also has 2 components,
# it represents the means you'd use to locate the desired element on the page.
# Selecting by CSS selector is fast, convenient and very popular.
# You can target all the attributes of a given DOM element and even specify their properties.

# "input[name='password']" represents the element we are selecting in a string.

# Scrolling to the bottom of the page
# n_scrolls represents the number of times our browser will scroll to the bottom of the page

# the first represents the y value to begin scrolling from (0 in our case, top of the page)
